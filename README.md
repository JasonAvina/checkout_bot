# Equipment Reminder Bot

This bot reads an Excel file of equipment checkouts and emails professors if their items are overdue.

# Structure

- Define the path to the Excel file
- Call load_checkout_data() to load the file
- If the file loads successfully:
    - Call add_parsed_return_dates() to parse fuzzy return dates
    - Call inspect_rows() to interactively view rows


## Current Goal

âœ… Load `.xlsx` file  
âœ… Add 'Parsed Return Date' column  
ðŸ”œ Print the first row  
ðŸ”œ Identify overdue items  
ðŸ”œ Send emails to responsible professors

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal or double-click `equipment_bot.pyw`

3. Check output in the terminal or logs
